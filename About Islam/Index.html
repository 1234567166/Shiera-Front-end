    <h1>Islam In Quran</h1>
    <p>Islam in the Qur’an is described as the true path of submission to Allah (God) <br> and the continuation of the guidance given to earlier prophets like Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), <br> and ‘Isa (Jesus, peace be upon them). The word “Islam” itself means submission<br> or surrender to the will of Allah.</p>
